# Lucene in Action 2: Example Implementations

This repository serves as a modern (as of v8.7.0) implementation of a lot of the
features and examples described in the book *Lucene in Action, Second Edition*.
Chapters 2-9 are covered and separated into packages based off of the part of the book
the example occurs in, and they are shown in both the src/main and src/test directories.

Some of the actual implementing classes may have been renamed 
or altered from those that appear in the book, so be sure to check classes and packages 
that sound similar in order to find something you may be looking for.

Many of the available examples can be run by invoking the main class or running the 
JUnit tests. It is recommended that you use IntelliJ or another IDE with a built-in debugger
so that you can step through the implementations and understand what's going on.

Please feel free to open a PR or contact me if you would like changes to be made to this 
repository.
